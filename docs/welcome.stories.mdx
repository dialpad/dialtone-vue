# Dialtone Vue ðŸ“ž

<Subtitle>
  Dialtone Vue is a library of Vue components for Dialtone, by Dialpad.
</Subtitle>

## Goals

The goal of the Dialtone Vue library is to simplify and standardize the use of common UI patterns and behaviour across all
Dialpad projects.

1. Implement Dialtone components and other common UI behaviour in a central place to ensure a consistent experience.
2. Abstract common patterns into a simple component interface to speed development.
3. Thoroughly document and test shared components to make using them fast and reliable.
4. Bake in accessibility features to ensure all our projects are usable by all users.
