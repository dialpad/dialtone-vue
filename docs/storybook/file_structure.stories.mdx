# File Structure

<Subtitle>
  Best Practices For Locating Stories
</Subtitle>

## File Naming

File names are used to determine which story or documentation page are to be registered for Storybook to display.

All files that end with `*.story.vue` will get parsed as single file component story templates.

All files that end with `*.stories.js` will get parsed as stories.

All files that end with `*.stories.mdx` will get parsed as documentation.

For your stories to be registered, they must adhere to the naming scheme just described.

## Folder Structure

All documentation stories should be placed in the `dialtone-vue/docs` directory following
a predictable structure to emulate the Storybook sidebar directory (although this does mean
they are implicitly mapped, more on this later).

Individual component stories should be colocated in their respective subdirectories containing the `.stories.js`, `.mdx`
`<COMPONENT_NAME>_default.story.vue` files.

### Example

```
# In dialtone-vue:

docs/
  component_driven_development/
    writing_component_tests.stories.mdx
    ...
  storybook/
    getting_started.stories.mdx
    ...
  welcome.stories.mdx
  ...
components/
  input
    input.stories.js
    input.mdx
  notice/
    notice_default.story.vue
    notice.stories.js
    notice.mdx
  ...
```
