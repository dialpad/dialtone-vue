# Tooltip

<Subtitle>
    A tooltip is a floating label that briefly explains an action, function, or an element.
    Its content is exclusively text and shouldn't be vital information for users.
    If richer media is desired, consider using a popover instead.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

The tooltip, also known as infotip or hint, is a common graphical user interface element in which, when hovering over a
screen element or component, a text box displays information about that element (such as a description of a button's
function, or what an abbreviation stands for). The tooltip is displayed continuously as long as the user hovers over the
element

A tooltip has two slots:

1. **the anchor** required slot
2. **the default** slot (which could be replaced with prop message)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="elements-tooltip--default" />
</Canvas>

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story id="elements-tooltip--variants" />
</Canvas>

## Props, Slots & Events

<ArgsTable of={DtTooltip} />

## Styles

1. **Twelve directions are offered:** three on each face of the tooltip.
2. **Inverted:** Inverts styles to work on dark backgrounds.

## Anchor

The anchor element that activates the tooltip should be fully accessible by keyboard. The easiest way to do this is by
using an element like an `DtButton` that is already accessible. The user should also be able to close the tooltip
content using the `ESC` key for most ARIA roles.

There are some required ARIA attributes for the anchor element (such as `aria-hidden` set based on `open`).
To make this as straightforward as possible, these ARIA attributes are passed
with the correct values as the `attrs` to the anchor slot. Applying them is as simple as using `v-bind`:

## Accessibility

1. Ensures more reliable voiceover support.
2. Reads out the tooltip content as a supplementary description for its trigger when the trigger is focused.

### Focus & Keyboard

Due to the different contexts in which a tooltip can be used, focus management and
keyboard shortcut ESC is provided.
You are encouraged to consult the ARIA documentation for the particular role

## Arrow Directions

Defines which side of the tooltip its arrow appears.
No arrow direction is assigned by default. You must select a direction.
