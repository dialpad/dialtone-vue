## Usage

### Import

```jsx
import { DtAvatar } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

### Seeded

You may use a seed to make the randomly generated color be the same every time for that seed. This is useful
if you want users to always have the same color, just pass in their unique user ID as the seed.

```jsx
// Will always show the same colors for this seed.
<dt-avatar
  seed="X5G3D7D3DS3WL7"
/>
```

### With Size

```jsx
<dt-avatar
  size="xs | sm | md | lg | xl"
/>
```
