# Banner

<Subtitle>
  Banners are a type of <a href="/?path=/docs/components-notice--default">notice</a>, delivering system and engagement
  messaging.
  These are highly intrusive notices and should be used sparingly and appropriately.
</Subtitle>

## Styles

System banners are used for **system** messaging. They are full-width notices placed in one of two locations:

1. **Above everything else:** If the banner is related to the entire app (e.g. the user lost internet service),
place the banner first. These should not be dismissable until the issue is resolved. To pin the banner to the top of
the app, add the `pinned` property.
2. **Below the top bar:** This is the default location for system banners. Use these when it affects only a particular
area of the product (e.g. when the user is in Do Not Disturb mode).
