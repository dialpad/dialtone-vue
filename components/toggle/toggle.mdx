# Toggle

<Subtitle>
  Toggles (aka "Switches") are control elements that allow the user to make a binary on/off selection.
  They are commonly used in places like settings and user preferences, but can appear in the product UI as well.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

Toggles are typically paired with a label which identifies the option.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-toggle--default" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

This component uses a native button element under the hood that has a role `switch` and type `button` to improve accessibility.

[See W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.2-20211129/examples/switch/switch-button.html)
for more information.

### Button

The button element should be fully accessible by keyboard. To accomplish this, the `DtToggle` component automatically
populates several ARIA attributes to the underlying `button` element depending on the checked and
disabled states. However, if a label prop or default slot is not
used with `DtToggle`, a console warning error will be thrown indicating that this issue exists.

### Focus & Keyboard

The button element should capture keyboard focus as long as it is not disabled (`disabled` prop is `true`).
`ENTER` key will
emit a **change** event with the current value of the toggle and will change its internal `checked` state.

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-toggle--variants" />
</Canvas>

## Slots, Props & Events

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
