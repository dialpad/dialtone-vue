# Dropdown

<Subtitle>
  A Dropdown presents a list of options or actions.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

The dropdown component provides accessibility controls when using with List item component.

The dropdown has 2 major pieces that are provided as required named slots: the anchor and the list.

The **anchor** slot contains the element that controls the dropdown's visibility.

The **list** slot contains a list of items to show as dropdown menu items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-dropdown--default" />
</Canvas>

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-dropdown--variants" />
</Canvas>

## Slots, Props & Events

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />

## Accessibility

The dropdown menu has a role of "menu" and the list items have a role "menuitem".

See [W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton) for more information.

### List

It is recommended to use `DtListItem` component as it supports all the necessary accessibility props and interactions.

### Focus & Keyboard

A dropdown menu has well defined standard
[keyboard interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html#kbd_label)
that it should support.
The focus will be set to the the active item on keyboard navigation. `UP` and `DOWN` arrows move the highlighted
selection between the list items. `HOME` and `END` keys will jump straight to the first or the last item.
Once the beginning or the end of the list is reached the selection will move to the opposite end of the list by default.
If you want custom behavior you can pass `onBeginningOfList` and `onEndOfList` methods as props.

Pressing `ESC` key while the dropdown has focus will emit an **escape** event and will close the menu. `ENTER` key will
emit a **select** event with the index of the currently highlighted list item. When the highlight
selection changes, a **highlight** event is emitted with the index of the currently highlighted item.
`SPACE` key will open the dropdown if it's closed and select the item when it's pressed on a list item.

## Usage

### Import

```jsx
import { DtDropdown, DtButton } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

```html
<dt-dropdown
  :open="isOpen"
  @highlight="onHighlight"
  @select="onSelect"
  @escape="onEscape"
  @update:open="updateOpen"
>
  <template #anchor="{ attrs }">
    <dt-button
      v-bind="attrs"
      @click.prevent="isOpen = !isOpen"
    >
      Click to open
    </dt-button>
  </template>
  <template #list>
    <dt-list-item
      v-for="(item, i) in items"
      :key="item.id"
      :navigation-type="navigationType"
      @click="onSelect(i)"
    >
      {{ item.name }}
    </dt-list-item>
  </template>
</dt-dropdown>
```

Note that the `anchor` slot that manages the list's visibility is using a similar pattern as in the
[Popover component](?path=/docs/components-popovers--default#basic-usage).
