# List Item

<Subtitle>
  A list item is an element that can be used to represent individual items in a list.
</Subtitle>

## Base Style

A list item provides accessibility controls and common functionality. The component uses child
components that provide styling and slots for different types of list items. If you want to create
a custom list item you can pass a type "custom", which will let you define the structure of the content.

The default list item has 5 slots that can be used for the most common use cases,
**left**, **right**, **default**, **subtitle** and **bottom** slot. All of the slots are optional.

The **left** slot can contain content, such as an avatar, that will be positioned to the left
of the main content.

The **right** slot works the same way, but its contents are placed to the right of the main slot.

The **default** slot contains the main content of the list item.

The **subtitle** slot can be used to display content below the default slot. The slot has smaller
text size and lighter color than default slot.

The **bottom** slot can be used to display content below the subtitle slot.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-list-item--default" />
</Canvas>

## Variants

### Custom List Item

When `type` is set to "custom" the list item will not render any styles or slots. This type can be
used when the list item has to support content that does not work with the default structure.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-list-item--custom" />
</Canvas>

## Slots, Props and Events

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />

## Accessibility

The list item should be provided an approriate role as the prop `role` or the role defaults to "listitem"
when not provided.

The item can receive focus using `focusable` prop.

When `navigation-type` is set to "tab" you can set `focusable=true` so the list item is set hover and focus styles and
a tabindex so that it can receive focus. This should be used for lists that contain mixed content, for example a list
in which some items are clickable/focusable and some are static.

When `navigation-type` is set to "arrow-keys" the props `setHighlight` and `isHighlighted` should
also be provided. When the list item receives a highlight either by hovering over it with a
mouse or via keyboard navigation the ARIA attribute `aria-selected` is set to "true".
