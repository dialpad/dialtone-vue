# Dialtone Vue üìû

Dialtone Vue is a library of Vue components for [Dialtone][dt]. The goal is to simplify and standardize the use of common UI patterns and behaviour across all Dialpad projects.

Dialtone Vue is available in Vue 2 as well as Vue 3:

## Project Status

Dialtone Vue is a new project, and as such it is under constant development as we add new components and refine existing ones. Please refer to the [jira board][jira] to see the status of Dialtone Vue components and request new components that should be in the Dialtone Vue library.

## Installation

You can install the Dialtone Vue library into your project via the following commands:

- Vue 2: `npm install @dialpad/dialtone-vue`
- Vue 3: `npm install @dialpad/dialtone-vue@vue3`

## Usage

Dialtone Vue components can be imported directly from the package. Some components also export named constants, which can be imported as well:

```js
import { DtInput, VALIDATION_MESSAGE_TYPES } from '@dialpad/dialtone-vue';
```

Projects using Dialtone Vue should be aware of the requirements:

- Dialtone classes must be made available globally (to avoid duplication, Dialtone Vue does not do this for you).
- A tool like Webpack must be used to package the SFC components from Dialtone Vue.
- LESS preprocessor support for Vue SFC `<style>` blocks.

These requirements are enforced via peerdependencies of Dialtone Vue when possible.
